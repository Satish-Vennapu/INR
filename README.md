##Implicit Neural Representation

Implicit Neural Representations parameterize a signal as a continuous function that maps the domain of the signal (i.e., a coordinate, such as a pixel coordinate for an image) to whatever is at that coordinate (for an image, an R,G,B color).

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged in the last few years as a powerful tool to encode continuously a variety of different signals like images, videos, audio and 3D shapes. When applied to 3D shapes, INRs allow to overcome the fragmentation and shortcomings of the popular discrete representations used so far.
